## Installation

You can install the last available released version from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=tufte)

``` r
install.packages('tufte')
```

You can also install the development version of **tufte** from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("rstudio/tufte")

pak::pkg_install("rstudio/tufte")
```

## Usage

The easiest way to make a new R Markdown document using Tufte style is from within RStudio. Go to _File > New File > R Markdown > From template > Tufte Handout_.

This can also be created from the command line using

```r
rmarkdown::draft("tufte.Rmd", "tufte_html", "tufte")
```
